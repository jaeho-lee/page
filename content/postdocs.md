Currently, I have **one** opening for the postdoc position.

# JOB DESCRIPTION

Your primary responsibility is to conduct high-quality research. Occasionally, I may ask you to assist me in advising students and fulfilling grant-related documents; these secondary duties are negotiable.

# QUALIFICATIONS
There are two qualifications: (1) Doctoral degree in ML-related subjects (CS/EE/AI/Math/IE ...), and (2) Good publication records in ML-related conferences. `If your degree is on something else, but have a really cool plan for an interdisciplinary research, feel free to contact me as well!`

# HOW TO APPLY
Send me an [email](mailto:jaeho-lee@kaist.ac.kr) with **a CV and a short research statement**, and optionally any other supplementary materials you want. `Later in the process, I may ask for one letter of recommendation.`
