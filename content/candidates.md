Thank you for your interest! I am looking for self-motivated students and postdocs; I'm looking forward to meet you and make fascinating discoveries as a research group.

Please don't hesitate send me an email right away (__jaeho-lee (at) kaist.ac.kr__). Make sure to attach a CV, portfolio, or anything similar.

Here are some FAQs for prospective graduate students:

- **Research Topics.** _Any ML-related topic_ is fine; I'll make sure to spend enough time to be a worthy discussant. If you are interested in _efficient ML_ or _learning theory_, you can definitely expect more from me ;) I am also very interested in the topics related to the algorithmic fairness and robustness.

- **Minimum Qualifications.** I have high expectations about your work ethics. You should also have strong mathematical foundations, be proficient in English, and have some computational skills.

- **Preferred Qualifications.** I wish our research group to be a place where each member contributes with their unique strength. Life in academia is a little bit of everything; you need to code, prove, write, draw, make videos, dig through ancient documents, persuade people to fund your research, et cetera. Thus I am looking for candidates with diverse backgrounds and skills. If you already have some research or work experiences (regardless of the field), that's fantastic. If you are a math/coding guru, that would be excellent too. If you know how to write or design, I really want to learn a lot from you.

- **Application procedure.** Unfortunately, there's a department-level screening procedure. You should apply directly to the [EE@POSTECH](https://ee.postech.ac.kr/admission/graduate-school/).
