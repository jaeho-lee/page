<br/>

I have **multiple openings** for graduate students at all levels.

---

# MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

I have high expectations about your work ethics and professionalism (and I'm planning to keep it that way).

You should also have solid mathematical foundations, be proficient in English, and have some computational skills.

`(Of course, you need your B.S. degree)`

# DESIRED QUALITIES

I wish our research group to be a place where each member contributes with their unique strength. Life in academia is a little bit of everything; you need to code, prove, write, draw, make videos, dig through ancient documents, persuade people to fund your research, et cetera. Thus I am looking for candidates with diverse backgrounds and skills. If you already have some research or work experiences (regardless of the field), that's fantastic. If you are a math/coding guru, that would be excellent too. If you know how to write or design, I really want to learn a lot from you.


# APPLICATION

Please send me an email with **a CV (or equivalent) and the official transcript** attached.

You should also apply to the [EE@POSTECH](https://ee.postech.ac.kr/admission/graduate-school/) before the deadline; there is a department-level screening procedure.
