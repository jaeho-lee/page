I'm a machine learning researcher at the [ALIN-Lab@KAIST](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr), hosted by the venerable [Jinwoo Shin](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html). Before joining here, I completed my Ph.D. studies at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu), under the supervision of (the glorious) [Maxim Raginsky](http://maxim.ece.illinois.edu).

I'm trying to figure out (1) the best ways to impose various constraints on machine learning algorithms---e.g., sparsity, robustness, or fairness---and (2) how these constraints alter the properties of learned hypotheses. To do this, I design algorithms and prove theorems.

__I'll be joining [POSTECH EE](https://ee.postech.ac.kr) as an assistant professor, starting in Spring 2022.__ If you are interested in working with me, please visit [this page](https://jaeho-lee.github.io/candidates/).
