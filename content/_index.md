I am an ML researcher at [ALIN@KAIST](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr), working with the venerable [Jinwoo Shin](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html). Before joining here, I completed my Ph.D. studies at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu), under the supervision of the glorious [Maxim Raginsky](http://maxim.ece.illinois.edu).

My research focuses on *learning under constraints:* I am trying to figure out (1) the best ways to impose various constraints on machine learning algorithms---e.g., sparsity, robustness, or fairness---and (2) how these constraints alter the properties of learned hypotheses. To do this, I design algorithms and prove theorems.

__Â¡Recruiting! Starting in March 2022, I am joining [POSTECH EE](https://ee.postech.ac.kr) as an assistant professor.__ If you are interested in working with me, please visit [this page](https://jaeho-lee.github.io/candidates/).
