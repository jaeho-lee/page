`I design algorithms and prove theorems.`

I am a (noob) assistant professor at POSTECH EE, who's trying to __make ML more efficient.__

If you are here for the graduate school admissions, please take a look at the [EffL group webpage](https://effl.notion.site).


# BRIEF BIO
Before coming to the P-Town, I was a postdoc researcher at KAIST AI where I worked with [Jinwoo Shin](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html) on algorithmic aspects of machine learning. Even before that, I completed my Ph.D. at the lovely cornfields of UIUC, under the supervision of (the glorious) [Maxim Raginsky](http://maxim.ece.illinois.edu) who trained me as a theoretician.
