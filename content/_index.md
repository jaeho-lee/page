`I design algorithms and prove theorems.`


I am a soon-to-join assistant professor at [POSTECH EE](https://ee.postech.ac.kr) who's trying to __make ML Efficient.__ If you are interested in working with me, please visit [here](/withme/).

# RESEARCH

Most of my research revolves around one message: _**You Should Make Your Learner Smaller!**_
- Some papers give algorithms to train deep models with small memory/compute footprints.
- Some theoretically analyzes how small can these models be.
- Other theoretical papers investigates what happens when you _constrain_ your learning space with robustness/fairness constraints.

To find out more, please see my [papers](/papers/).

# BIO
Currently I am an ML researcher at KAIST, working with the venerable [Jinwoo Shin](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html). Before coming to Daejeon, I completed my Ph.D. studies at the lovely cornfields of UIUC, under the supervision of the glorious [Maxim Raginsky](http://maxim.ece.illinois.edu).
