`I design algorithms and prove theorems.`

__ðŸ”¥RECRUITINGðŸ”¥__  
**Starting in March 2022, I am joining [POSTECH EE](https://ee.postech.ac.kr) as an assistant professor**. If you are interested in working with me, please visit [this page](https://jaeho-lee.github.io/candidates/).



# RESEARCH
I am broadly interested in theoretical & algorithmic aspects of ML. My recent research focus is on **Efficient Deep Learning.** In particular, in my recent works I try to
- Design neat DL algorithms with small memory/computation footprints
- Understand theoretical properties of resource-constrained learning algorithms.

I have also worked on the topics of **Machine Bias** and **Robust ML**. See my [papers](/papers/) to find out more.



# BIO

I am an ML researcher at [ALIN@KAIST](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr), working with the venerable [Jinwoo Shin](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html). Before coming to Daejeon, I completed my Ph.D. studies at the lovely cornfields of [UIUC](https://illinois.edu), under the supervision of the glorious [Maxim Raginsky](http://maxim.ece.illinois.edu).
