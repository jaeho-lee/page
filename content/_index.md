`I design algorithms and prove theorems.`


I am a (noob) assistant professor at [POSTECH EE](https://ee.postech.ac.kr) who's trying to __make ML more efficient.__ I just started a research group called __EffL Lab__ (Efficient Learning) with three bright students.

# BRIEF BIO
Before coming to the P-Town, I was a postdoc researcher at KAIST AI where I worked with [Jinwoo Shin](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html) on algorithmic aspects of machine learning. Even before that, I completed my Ph.D. at the lovely cornfields of UIUC, under the supervision of (the glorious) [Maxim Raginsky](http://maxim.ece.illinois.edu) who trained me as a theoretician.
