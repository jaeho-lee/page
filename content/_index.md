I am an ML researcher at [ALIN@KAIST](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr), working with the venerable [Jinwoo Shin](https://alinlab.kaist.ac.kr/shin.html). Before joining here, I completed my Ph.D. studies at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu), under the supervision of the glorious [Maxim Raginsky](http://maxim.ece.illinois.edu).

My research focuses on **learning under constraints.** In particular, I try to
- Find neat ways to impose various constraints on ML algorithms `(e.g., sparsity, robustness, fairness)`
- Understand how such constraints alter properties of the learned hypothesis and learning procedure itself `(e.g., w.r.t. generalization and optimization)`

To do this, I design algorithms and develop theories.

**Starting in March 2022, I am joining [POSTECH EE](https://ee.postech.ac.kr) as an assistant professor**. If you are interested in working with me, please visit [this page](https://jaeho-lee.github.io/candidates/).
